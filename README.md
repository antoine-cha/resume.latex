# resume.latex
My resume using LaTeX.

The base template is modified from [muratcankaracabey/latex_cv](https://github.com/muratcankaracabey/latex_cv). This is a good template to learn more about LaTeX, as it is pretty short and straight forward.

The project has to be compiled with either `lualatex` or `xelatex` due to the use of the package `fontawesome`.
